    	    Our congregation utilizes the Gospels wrongfully declared as heretical (and, thereby, requiredly, extant) ‚Äî and the related Gospel upon which they are reliant ‚Äî during/following the times of the Apostalic Successive Roman Church Fathers (those who founded the institutional Christian movement which became the Byzantine Empire; the Holy Roman Empire; the "Catholic Church;" and beyond ‚Äî all per historical and "biblical" basis).

    	    We hold that these Works are self-evident; their rediscovery is paramount to a full understanding of the most original school of thought founded by "Jesus" / "Yeshua" / "Isa."  Anyone seeking Deity can, from these, glean the fundamental insights concerning that of Logos (which begets Gnosis; which begets Sofia).  We hold The Master in the highest regard, but we do not require that members consider Him as Deity incarnate; for, per our own Scripture, did He not laugh at His Disciples for Worshipping Him?  And so doest Paradox begin: These texts are but crude implements in the face of attaining Godhood; no text is required to find Provable Faith (as many a gnostic has, themselves, found prior to awareness of said Works).

    	    We do not require that members of our Ordo defer strictly to the content of these texts concerning the Cosmic Order; until reproducible beyond All Reason, we acknowledge the inherent limit in blind faith concerning the authenticity of any Documens supposedly found in our √Üon. As Logos requires undoubtable reproduction and Form, we defer only to the most basal, foundational concepts of Proofs of Eternal Truth: That We Are; that All can be Known; and that we serve as Vessels of the Almighty ‚Äî the First Mindful Power.  All else remains subject to deepest inquiry until through it doest Sofia Emerge.

    	    Our congregation acknowledges, with all reverence, that Gnosis is both the humbling Void and the fullness of All.  We, internally ‚Äî individually and together ‚Äî pilgrimage the Razor's Edge to Infinity.
